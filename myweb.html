        <p>To create a modern responsive portfolio with the name Mugabo Willy Fred using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can follow these steps:

First, create the basic structure of your portfolio using HTML. This will include elements such as the head, which contains metadata about your portfolio, and the body, which will contain the content of your portfolio.

Next, use CSS to style your portfolio. You can use CSS to control the layout of your portfolio, as well as the appearance of text and other elements. Make sure to use responsive design techniques to ensure that your portfolio looks good on a variety of devices and screen sizes.

Finally, you can use JavaScript to add interactivity to your portfolio. For example, you might use JavaScript to create a slideshow of your work, or to add a pop-up modal when someone clicks on a project.

Remember to keep your code organized and well-commented, as this will make it easier for you (or someone else) to maintain and update your portfolio in the future.</p>

        <h2>Column 2</h2>
        <p>To create a modern portfolio using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, you can follow these steps:

First, create the HTML structure for your portfolio page. This can include elements such as a header, navigation menu, sections for different types of content (e.g., about, projects, contact), and a footer. Use HTML tags to mark up the content and structure of your page.

Next, add styling to your page using CSS. You can use CSS to control the layout and design of your page, including the font, colors, and layout of different elements.

To make your portfolio responsive, you'll need to use media queries in your CSS. Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the size of the screen or viewport. This way, your page can adjust to look good on different devices, whether it's a large desktop screen or a small phone screen.

Use JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to your page. For example, you could use JavaScript to create a slideshow or to validate form input. You could also use JavaScript to create animations or to handle user input and events.</p>
